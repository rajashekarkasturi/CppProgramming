# Bit Manipulation in-built functions in cpp

### Set_bits in integer
```
std::cout << __builtin_popcount(int) << std::endl;
```

### Set_bits in long and LL
```
std::cout << __builtin_popcountll(int) << std::endl;
```

### Number of leading zeros in number n (same variation for ll as set_bits)
```
std::cout << __builtin_clz(int) << std::endl;
```
### Number of trailing zeros in number n
```
std::cout << __builtin_ctz(int) << std::endl;
```
